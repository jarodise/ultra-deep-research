# Deep Research Methodology: 8-Phase Pipeline

## Overview

This document contains the detailed methodology for conducting deep research. The 8 phases represent a comprehensive approach to gathering, verifying, and synthesizing information from multiple sources.

---

## Phase 1: SCOPE - Research Framing

**Objective:** Define research boundaries and success criteria

**Activities:**
1. Decompose the question into core components
2. Identify stakeholder perspectives
3. Define scope boundaries (what's in/out)
4. Establish success criteria
5. List key assumptions to validate

**Ultrathink Application:** Use extended reasoning to explore multiple framings of the question before committing to scope.

**Output:** Structured scope document with research boundaries

## Phase 2: PLAN - Strategy Formulation

**Objective:** Create an intelligent research roadmap

**Activities:**
1. Identify primary and secondary sources
2. Map knowledge dependencies (what must be understood first)
3. Create search query strategy with variants
4. Plan triangulation approach
5. Estimate time/effort per phase
6. Define quality gates

**Graph-of-Thoughts:** Branch into multiple potential research paths, then converge on optimal strategy.

**Output:** Research plan with prioritized investigation paths

## Phase 3: RETRIEVE - Information Gathering

**Objective:** Systematically collect information from multiple sources

**Activities:**
1. Execute web searches with iterative query refinement
2. Retrieve academic papers, documentation, repositories
3. Extract key passages with source metadata
4. Track information gaps
5. Follow promising tangents
6. Maintain source diversity

**Techniques:**
- Use WebSearch for current information
- Use WebFetch for deep dives into specific sources
- Use Grep/Read for local documentation
- Execute code for computational analysis
- Use Task tool to spawn parallel retrieval agents

**Output:** Organized information repository with source tracking

## Phase 4: TRIANGULATE - Cross-Reference Verification

**Objective:** Validate information across multiple independent sources

**Activities:**
1. Identify claims requiring verification
2. Cross-reference facts across 3+ sources
3. Flag contradictions or uncertainties
4. Assess source credibility
5. Note consensus vs. debate areas
6. Document verification status per claim

**Quality Standards:**
- Core claims must have 3+ independent sources
- Flag any single-source information
- Note recency of information
- Identify potential biases

**Output:** Verified fact base with confidence levels

---

## Phase 5: SYNTHESIZE - Deep Analysis

**Objective:** Connect insights and generate novel understanding

**Activities:**
1. Identify patterns across sources
2. Map relationships between concepts
3. Generate insights beyond source material
4. Create conceptual frameworks
5. Build argument structures
6. Develop evidence hierarchies

**Ultrathink Integration:** Use extended reasoning to explore non-obvious connections and second-order implications.

**Output:** Synthesized understanding with insight generation

---

## Phase 6: CRITIQUE - Quality Assurance

**Objective:** Rigorously evaluate research quality

**Activities:**
1. Review for logical consistency
2. Check citation completeness
3. Identify gaps or weaknesses
4. Assess balance and objectivity
5. Verify claims against sources
6. Test alternative interpretations

**Red Team Questions:**
- What's missing?
- What could be wrong?
- What alternative explanations exist?
- What biases might be present?
- What counterfactuals should be considered?

**Output:** Critique report with improvement recommendations

---

## Phase 7: REFINE - Iterative Improvement

**Objective:** Address gaps and strengthen weak areas

**Activities:**
1. Conduct additional research for gaps
2. Strengthen weak arguments
3. Add missing perspectives
4. Resolve contradictions
5. Enhance clarity
6. Verify revised content

**Output:** Strengthened research with addressed deficiencies

---

## Phase 8: PACKAGE - Report Generation

**Objective:** Deliver professional, actionable research

**Activities:**
1. Structure report with clear hierarchy
2. Write executive summary
3. Develop detailed sections
4. Create visualizations (tables, diagrams)
5. Compile full bibliography
6. Add methodology appendix

**Output:** Complete research report ready for use

## Advanced Features

### Graph-of-Thoughts Reasoning

Rather than linear thinking, branch into multiple reasoning paths:
- Explore alternative framings in parallel
- Pursue tangential leads that might be relevant
- Merge insights from different branches
- Backtrack and revise as new information emerges

### Parallel Agent Deployment

Use Task tool to spawn sub-agents for:
- Parallel source retrieval
- Independent verification paths
- Competing hypothesis evaluation
- Specialized domain analysis

### Adaptive Depth Control

Automatically adjust research depth based on:
- Information complexity
- Source availability
- Time constraints
- Confidence levels

### Citation Intelligence

Smart citation management:
- Track provenance of every claim
- Link to original sources
- Assess source credibility
- Handle conflicting sources
- Generate proper bibliographies
