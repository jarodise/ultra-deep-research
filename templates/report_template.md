# Research Report: [Topic]

<!-- IMPORTANT: This report should be COMPREHENSIVE and DETAILED -->
<!-- Target length: 2,000-5,000 words minimum for standard mode -->
<!-- Target length: 5,000-10,000 words for deep/ultradeep mode -->
<!-- Do NOT write summaries - write FULL detailed analysis -->

<!-- WRITING STANDARDS: -->
<!-- - PRECISION: Each word deliberately chosen, carries intention -->
<!-- - ECONOMY: No fluff, eliminate fancy grammar, unnecessary adjectives -->
<!-- - CLARITY: Use exact numbers, specific data, precise technical terms -->
<!-- - DIRECTNESS: State findings without embellishment -->
<!-- - HIGH SIGNAL-TO-NOISE: Respect reader's time, dense information -->
<!-- Examples: "reduced mortality 23%" not "significantly improved outcomes" -->
<!-- Examples: "5 RCTs (n=1,847)" not "several studies suggest" -->
